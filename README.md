# Spinning-Wheels
This is the animated illusion, consisting of concentric circles with
spokes, each turning in the opposite direction from the adjacent
circles. They appear to be spinning at different angular speeds, but in
fact are all spinning at the same speed. Pressing and holding the
mouse reveals a red spoke on each wheel that shows that the wheels
are all spinning at the same speed.
